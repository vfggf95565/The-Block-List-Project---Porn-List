# The-Block-List-Project - Porn-List
Primary Block Lists

&nbsp;

# Details:

These lists were created because the founder of the project wanted something with a little more control over what is being blocked. Many lists out there are all or nothing. We set out to create lists with more control over what is being blocked and believe that we have accomplished that.
